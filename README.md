# Epicodus Track Survey

#### A Survey to help you find out what language track you should take at Epicodus

#### By Eric Shull

## Description

This is a survey with five questions to determine which track is best for you at Epicodus. Each of the five questions has four answers with a specific value attached to each answer. The sum of the answer values determines which of the three tracks you should take. The fourth option is maybe you shouldn't be a developer. This fourth option is based off of low interest in the five questions.
